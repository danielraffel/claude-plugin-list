Enforces official Claude best practices including name validation (64 chars, lowercase/hyphens), description limits (1024 chars), SKILL.md line count (<500 lines), third-person writing style, progressive disclosure depth (one level), and multi-model testing verification. Prevents outdated documentation, incorrect API patterns, contradictory examples, version drift, broken links, YAML errors, schema inconsistencies, missing dependencies, Windows paths, inconsistent terminology, and over-explained content. Combines automated technical checks (YAML syntax, package versions, link validation, TODO markers) with AI-powered verification.
